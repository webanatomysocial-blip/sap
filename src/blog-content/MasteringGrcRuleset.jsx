          <p>
            Managing access risk effectively is one of the toughest challenges
            in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks—especially
            within SAP landscapes that span on-premise systems, cloud
            applications, and hybrid architectures. With the release of SAP GRC
            Access Control 12.0 Support Package 25, SAP introduced a powerful
            new capability designed to transform how rulesets are managed: the
            Ruleset Manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help SAP GRC professionals, security consultants, auditors, and
            architects understand and leverage this capability, I’m sharing this
            comprehensive video overview of the Ruleset Manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            In SAP GRC Access Control, a ruleset is a structured collection of
            risk definitions that guide how segregation-of-duties (SoD) and
            other compliance checks are performed. These rules are the
            foundation for Access Risk Analysis (ARA) as they define the
            combinations of transactions and permissions that may lead to
            control violations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditionally, configuring, updating, and transporting these
            rulesets across systems has been cumbersome—requiring multiple
            reports, disparate files, and manual overhead.
          </p>

          <h2>What the Ruleset Manager Offers?</h2>
          <p>
            With the Ruleset Manager introduced in SAP GRC Access Control 12.0
            SP25:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Centralized Rule Management:</strong> You can view,
              modify, import, and export rulesets in a unified interface,
              removing the need to piece together multiple files or reports.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhanced Control Over Risk Definitions:</strong> Rulesets
              can be customized to align with your organization’s unique risk
              taxonomy—whether standard SoD conflicts or company-specific
              controls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simplified Transport Across Systems:</strong> Managed
              rulesets can be packaged and transported more easily, improving
              consistency across development, testing, and production
              landscapes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These improvements significantly reduce operational friction and
            enhance audit readiness.

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            The introduction of the Ruleset Manager in SAP GRC marks a
            meaningful upgrade in how organizations can control risk definitions
            and maintain compliance standards. Whether you manage rule sets
            manually today or are planning a migration to the latest GRC
            platform, mastering this capability will significantly improve your
            access risk governance.
