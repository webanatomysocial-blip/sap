          <p>
            Traditional SAP audits were designed for a world where customers
            owned the system end to end. Auditors validated controls by
            inspecting configuration screens, reviewing system logs, tracing
            changes, and confirming that powerful technical access was tightly
            restricted. Visibility equalled assurance, and depth of access was
            synonymous with risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud fundamentally breaks this model.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the public cloud, many of the controls auditors historically
            relied upon are no longer operated – or even visible – by the
            customer. Configuration scope is restricted, technical override
            paths are removed, and critical safeguards are enforced at the
            platform level. When traditional audit techniques are applied
            unchanged, they often conclude that “controls are missing,” when in
            reality those controls have been replaced by preventive design.
          </p>
          <p>
            This disconnect is why traditional SAP audit controls fail in Public
            Cloud.
          </p>

          <h2>The Shift Audits Struggle to Make</h2>
          <p>
            The most significant change in SAP Public Cloud is not technical-it
            is conceptual. Control ownership moves away from the customer and
            into the platform. Instead of executing and monitoring every
            control, customers now rely on controls that cannot be bypassed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Audits built on system-level testing struggle with this shift
            because they are optimized for detective validation: proving that
            something happened correctly after the fact. Public Cloud
            prioritizes prevention: unsafe actions are simply not possible. The
            absence of familiar evidence is therefore not a weakness; it is
            often proof that the control has moved upstream into the
            architecture.
          </p>

          <h2>When Visibility No Longer Equals Risk</h2>
          <p>
            In traditional SAP environments, high visibility often came with
            high risk. Broad access existed, and controls were required to
            manage it. In Public Cloud, reduced visibility is intentional and
            directly correlated with reduced risk. Configuration options are
            limited, customization paths are standardized, and lifecycle
            activities are governed by the platform itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Audits that equate “less access” or “less evidence” with “less
            control” misread this reality. The risk surface has not disappeared
            – it has shrunk.
          </p>

          <h2>Assurance Without Direct Control</h2>
          <p>
            A defining characteristic of Public Cloud audits is reliance on
            assurance rather than execution. Customers do not validate platform
            integrity by inspecting internal mechanisms; they rely on provider
            assurances, independently audited reports, and contractual
            commitments. This is standard practice across mature cloud
            ecosystems, but it remains uncomfortable for auditors accustomed to
            direct system inspection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effective auditing in this model focuses on whether this reliance is
            understood, documented, and governed – not on attempting to recreate
            access that the platform intentionally withholds.
          </p>

          <h2>The Cost of Applying the Wrong Controls</h2>
          <p>
            When audits insist on legacy control evidence, organizations are
            forced into defensive behaviours: excessive documentation, manual
            reconciliations, and compensating controls that exist only to
            satisfy outdated expectations. These activities consume time and
            budget without materially improving security. Worse, they create
            false positives – findings that signal non-compliance where none
            exists. Over time, this erodes confidence in audit outcomes and
            distracts attention from real risk areas that still require
            scrutiny, such as access governance, data protection, and
            operational oversight.
          </p>

          <h2>What Effective Public Cloud Audits Actually Validate</h2>
          <p>
            Modern SAP Public Cloud audits derive value not from technical
            depth, but from control alignment. They assess whether governance
            structures are in place, responsibilities are clearly defined,
            approvals are enforced, and reliance on platform controls is
            consciously managed. Evidence becomes contextual rather than
            mechanical, reflecting where accountability truly sits.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach produces clearer conclusions, fewer disputes, and more
            meaningful assurance.
          </p>

          <h2>Rethinking Audit Maturity</h2>
          <p>
            Audit maturity in the Public Cloud is no longer measured by how much
            of the system can be inspected, but by how accurately risk is
            understood. Auditors who adapt their methods recognize that fewer
            visible controls often indicate stronger security, not weaker
            oversight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who do not risk auditing a modern platform with assumptions
            designed for a different era.
