            At #SAPSecurityExpert, we regularly highlight valuable knowledge
            from across the SAP security ecosystem. In this post, we are
            featuring an insightful podcast episode from the CyberKriya Podcast,
            which brings together voices from the global SAPCyberSecurity
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the inaugural episode of the CyberKriya Podcast, focused on
            strengthening practitioner awareness around emerging SAP
            cybersecurity and AI-driven risk themes.
          </p>

            This episode explores several timely and thought-provoking topics,

          <ul>
            <li>The current and evolving SAP Cybersecurity threat landscape</li>
            <li>
              Practical implications of Agentic AI in enterprise environments
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
              The need for modern AI threat modeling approaches within SAP

            , co-authored by Ron F. Del Rosario, Head of AI Security for SAP
            ISBN, and Jay Thoden van Velzen.
