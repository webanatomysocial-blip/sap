          <p>
            SAP's cloud strategy is no longer aspirational—it is directive. With
            Clean Core, Cloud-First, and continuous innovation as foundational
            principles, enterprises are being nudged—sometimes pushed—toward
            standardized, upgrade-safe SAP landscapes. Programs such as RISE
            with SAP (Private Cloud) and GROW with SAP (Public Cloud) reflect
            this shift, offering differentiated cloud paths based on business
            maturity, industry complexity, and risk posture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, while infrastructure and functional scope often dominate cloud
            discussions, security remains the silent decision-maker. The choice
            between S/4HANA Public Cloud and S/4HANA Private Cloud is, at its
            core, a decision about how much control an enterprise is willing to
            retain versus how much responsibility it is willing to delegate to
            SAP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding this difference is essential — especially in the
            context of Clean Core and regulated enterprise environments.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Security Models Had to Change</h2>
          <p>
            SAP's Clean Core strategy aims to minimize custom code, enforce
            standardization, and ensure seamless upgrades. From a security
            standpoint, this directly impacts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How authorizations are designed</li>
            <li>How Segregation of Duties (SoD) is managed</li>
            <li>How audit evidence is produced</li>
            <li>Who owns risk remediation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            S/4HANA Public Cloud represents the purest expression of Clean Core.
            Security is tightly governed, standardized, and embedded into
            SAP-delivered roles. Customers are expected to adapt their processes
            to SAP best practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            S/4HANA Private Cloud, while still aligned to Clean Core principles,
            offers a controlled transition path. Enterprises can modernize while
            retaining proven security constructs—custom roles, SAP GRC, and
            industry-specific controls—especially critical during brownfield
            conversions under RISE with SAP.
          </p>

          <h2>Security Philosophy: Guardrails vs. Governance</h2>
          <p>
            In Public Cloud, SAP enforces security through strict guardrails.
            Customers operate within predefined boundaries, reducing risk by
            design but limiting flexibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Private Cloud, SAP provides the platform, while enterprises
            retain security governance authority. This is particularly relevant
            for organizations with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complex SoD matrices</li>
            <li>Internal audit mandates</li>
            <li>
              Regulatory oversight (SOX, financial controls, industry audits)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This philosophical divide becomes most visible when we examine
            access control and risk management.
          </p>

          <h2>RISE vs. GROW: Security Drives the Path</h2>
          <p>From a security stand-point:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>GROW with SAP (Public Cloud)</strong> is best suited for
              organizations that can accept standardized controls, minimal
              customization, and SAP-managed compliance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>RISE with SAP (Private Cloud)</strong> aligns better with
              enterprises undergoing transformation while preserving existing
              risk frameworks, GRC investments, and audit models.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many enterprises choose Private Cloud not to avoid Clean Core—but to
            reach it responsibly, without compromising control during
            transition.
          </p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts: Security Is the Deciding Factor</h2>
          <p>
            As highlighted, the move to SAP Cloud is inevitable. The way you
            move is strategic.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Choose <strong>Public Cloud</strong> if speed, standardization,
              and simplicity outweigh the need for granular control.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose <strong>Private Cloud</strong> if compliance, auditability,
              and security governance are non-negotiable.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In a Clean Core, Cloud-First world, security is no longer about
            adding controls—it is about choosing the right control boundary.
          </p>
