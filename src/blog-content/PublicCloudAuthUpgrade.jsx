          <p>
            SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud continues evolving with each quarterly
            release, and the 2508 upgrade cycle brings critical updates across
            Identity & Access Management (IAM), business catalogues, restriction
            types, and SAP-delivered role templates. These changes are designed
            to strengthen security, optimise business role design, and align
            system authorisations with SAP's best-practice access model.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure a smooth transition to release 2508, organisations must
            adopt a proactive IAM governance model. This comprehensive guide
            explains the exact steps, methodology, governance approach, and
            controls needed to execute IAM changes successfully during this
            specific upgrade cycle. The structured approach outlined here will
            help organisations navigate the complexities of IAM release
            management whilst maintaining security compliance and operational
            continuity throughout the upgrade process.

          <h2>
            Why Public Cloud Authorization Release Management Is Critical for
            Enterprise
          </h2>

            <p className="image-caption">
              Recommended IAM Upgrade Framework for Release
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Each SAP Public Cloud upgrade introduces mandatory IAM changes that
            organisations must systematically address. For release 2508,
            organisations can expect new business catalogues to enable new
            features, deprecation of catalogues introduced in prior cycles,
            changes to business role templates, new or modified IAM apps, new
            restriction fields and access controls, and updated dependency
            catalogues between roles and apps.
          </p>

          <h3>Critical Risks of Inadequate IAM Management</h3>
          <p>
            Failure to adopt these changes may result in missing authorisations
            post-upgrade, business process disruption, incomplete or insecure
            access control, and compliance and audit findings. This makes
            structured IAM upgrade execution essential for maintaining
            operational integrity and regulatory compliance.
          </p>

          <h2>Recommended IAM Upgrade Framework for Release</h2>
          <p>
            SAP follows a comprehensive four-pillar IAM framework for every
            release cycle, ensuring controlled and compliant access management
            at go-live. This structured approach provides organisations with a
            clear roadmap for navigating the complexities of IAM upgrades whilst
            maintaining security standards and operational continuity.

          </div>

          <h2>Planning for Public Cloud IAM Upgrade Activities</h2>
          <p>
            The 2508 IAM upgrade follows a carefully orchestrated timeline
            spanning six distinct phases, each with specific activities and
            deliverables. Understanding this timeline is crucial for effective
            resource planning, stakeholder coordination, and risk mitigation
            throughout the upgrade process.

          <h2>Step-by-Step Execution: Pre-Release Preparation</h2>
          <div className="blog-inline-image">
            <img src={img4} alt="Test System Validation" />
            <p className="image-caption">
              Test system serves as observation environment
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The pre-release preparation phase, conducted four weeks before the
            Test upgrade, is the foundation for successful IAM upgrade
            execution. This phase requires meticulous attention to detail and
            comprehensive stakeholder engagement to ensure that all potential
            impacts are identified and addressed before any system changes
            occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this critical period, organisations must download and
            thoroughly review the IAM delta spreadsheet from SAP Note 2975653,
            which provides detailed information about all changes introduced in
            release 2508. The What's New Viewer offers additional context about
            new features and functionality that may impact IAM configurations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Goal:</strong> No surprises when Test system upgrades.
            Complete preparation ensures smooth execution and minimises business
            disruption.
          </p>

          <h2>Test System Upgrade – Validate Behaviour</h2>
          <p>
            The Test system upgrade phase represents a critical validation
            checkpoint in the IAM release management process. During this phase,
            organisations must focus on understanding how the upgrade affects
            existing configurations without making any modifications to
            productive roles within the Test environment.
          </p>
          <div className="blog-inline-image">

          <p>
            Review Business Role Templates in the Manage Business Role Changes
            After Upgrade application to understand what SAP has modified in the
            standard templates. Test new features and UI behaviour to ensure
            that business processes will function as expected after the upgrade.
            This validation phase provides crucial insights that will inform the
            changes made in the Development environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Test system serves as an observation environment during this
            phase, allowing teams to understand the upgrade's impact without
            risking productive configurations. All actual modifications will be
            performed in the Development environment following the prescribed
            change management process.
          </p>

          <h2>Upgrade Custom Business Roles</h2>
          <div className="blog-inline-image">

              Development → Test → Production flow
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Upgrading custom business roles represents the most complex and
            critical phase of the IAM release management process. This phase
            requires systematic attention to multiple areas, each with specific
            requirements and validation steps to ensure comprehensive role
            maintenance.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Manage Business Role Changes</strong> – Analyse
              differences between current and upgraded states, adopt changes
              systematically
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Catalogues App</strong> – Replace deprecated
              catalogues with successor versions and validate dependencies
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintain Business Roles</strong> – Update restrictions and
              perform manual adjustments as required by business needs
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>IAM Key Figures</strong> – Validate unmaintained
              restriction fields and ensure complete configuration
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Transport to Test & Production</h2>
          <p>
            The transport phase represents the culmination of all development
            work, moving validated IAM changes through the system landscape to
            Test and Production environments. This phase requires strict
            adherence to transport protocols and comprehensive validation
            procedures.
          </p>
          <div className="blog-inline-image">
            <img src={img7} alt="Transport Methods" />
            <p className="image-caption">
              Recommended Method – Export Software Collection

          </p>

          <p>
            Perform comprehensive business test scripts for all impacted roles
            before approving transport to Production. These test scripts should
            cover critical business processes, edge cases, and integration
            points to ensure that the upgraded roles function correctly in all
            scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Export Software Collection method provides superior consistency
            and traceability compared to manual transport methods. It ensures
            that all related objects are transported together, maintaining
            dependencies and reducing the risk of incomplete or inconsistent
            deployments. Organisations should establish clear approval gates at
            each stage of the transport process, with documented sign-offs from
            technical teams, business stakeholders, and compliance functions.
            Recommended Method – Export Software Collection (recommended for
            consistency and reliability)

            <p className="image-caption">Validation using IAM Key Figures</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The post-go-live phase is critical for ensuring that the IAM upgrade
            has been successfully implemented and that all systems are
            functioning as expected. This phase requires systematic validation,
            monitoring, and documentation to confirm that the upgrade objectives
            have been achieved.
          </p>

          <p>
            Post-go-live validation should be conducted systematically over the
            first few days following Production deployment. Establish clear
            escalation procedures for any issues identified during this period,
            ensuring that technical teams and business stakeholders can respond
            quickly to resolve problems. Document all validation activities,
            test results, and issue resolutions to create a comprehensive audit
            trail that demonstrates due diligence and supports future upgrade
            cycles.
