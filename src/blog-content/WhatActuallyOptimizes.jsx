          <p>
            SAP license compliance is not driven by a single report or
            transaction. It is the outcome of multiple SAP-delivered mechanisms,
            each operating at a different stage of the licensing lifecycle.
            Organizations that fail to understand this layered model often
            struggle with rising SAP costs, repeated audit findings, and
            unnecessary investment in overlapping optimization tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the core of SAP license measurement are three foundational
            components:

              USMM, LAW/SLAW, and STAR - The three layers of SAP license
              measurement
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            While these are frequently referenced together, they serve distinct
            and non-interchangeable purposes. Understanding how they work
            together—and where optimization value truly resides—is essential for
            sustainable SAP license governance.
          </p>

          <h2>USMM: The Data Collection Layer</h2>
          <p>
            USMM is the starting point of SAP license measurement. Its
            responsibility is purely factual and technical. USMM captures named
            users, engines, and package usage. It classifies users based on
            technical attributes and is used to generate system-level
            measurement data.
          </p>

          <p>USMM does not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interpret business relevance</li>
            <li>Optimize license assignments</li>
            <li>Assess authorization-driven over-classification</li>
          </ul>

          <p>USMM answers only one question:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>"What usage data exists in the system?"</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>LAW / SLAW: The Compliance and Consolidation Layer</h2>
          <p>
            LAW (and its successor SLAW/SLAW2) is the official SAP consolidation
            mechanism used during license measurement cycles.
          </p>

          <p>
            LAW/SLAW consolidates USMM results across multiple SAP systems,
            applies contractual aggregation and measurement rules defined by SAP
            and produces the consolidated compliance position shared during
            audits.
          </p>

          <p>LAW/SLAW does not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Analyze authorizations</li>
            <li>Identify optimization opportunities</li>
            <li>Explain why and how licenses are consumed</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>"What is the consolidated compliance position?"</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>STAR Analysis: The Intelligence and Optimization Layer</h2>
          <p>
            STAR (S/4HANA Trusted Authorization Review) Analysis operates at a
            fundamentally different level. Rather than relying on technical user
            types alone, STAR:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Analyzes user authorizations and role content</li>
            <li>Determines the minimum required license classification</li>
            <li>Identifies over-licensed and misclassified users</li>
            <li>Highlights systemic role wise licensing information</li>
          </ul>

          <p>STAR answers the most critical question in SAP licensing:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              "What license is actually required based on what users are allowed
              to do?"
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            This is where true optimization insight is created. All three are
            required, but only STAR produces actionable intelligence.
          </p>

          <h2>Q) Is STAR Enough for my Licensing Optimization?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Technically YES!</strong> Many organizations over-invest in
            license saver solutions or tools before stabilizing fundamentals. In
            practice, STAR alone is often sufficient when:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>License exposure is driven by role and authorization sprawl</li>
            <li>The objective is cost optimization, not just reporting</li>
            <li>Audit readiness must be defensible and SAP-aligned</li>
            <li>Internal teams can remediate roles and user assignments</li>
            <li>There is a desire to reduce dependency on expensive tooling</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In these scenarios, STAR delivers the majority of optimization value
            by correcting license classification at its source.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Q) Do I need to procure additional licenses to utilize STAR analysis
            similar to third-party licensing tools?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>No.</strong> You don't need any additional licenses and it
            can be installed directly in the existing SAP S/4HANA system (Check
            pre-requisites). Refer to SAP Note 3113382.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> While STAR itself is not a single SAP Note,
            specific Notes are often referenced in community and internal SAP
            guides to support STAR-related activities. Additional references
            were provided at the bottom of the blog.
          </p>

          <h2>Q) How do I use this report?</h2>
          <p>
            Once the note is implemented, use the program{" "}
            <strong>SLIM_USER_CLF_HELP</strong> to help determine license
            classifications. You can refer to the note which details all the
            steps to deploy and utilize the solution.
          </p>

          <h2>Q) When do you need external Tools?</h2>
          <p>
            Specialized optimization tools can add value when scale and
            orchestration become limiting factors.
          </p>
          <p>Tools are typically beneficial when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Managing very large or highly distributed SAP landscapes with
              large amount of users, contracts, and UDD agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Executive dashboards and consolidated reporting are mandatory
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even then, tools are most effective only when anchored to STAR-based
            intelligence. Automation amplifies insight—it does not replace it.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Takeaway:</h2>
          <p>SAP license measurement is a layered process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>USMM</strong> collects
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>LAW/SLAW</strong> consolidates
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>STAR</strong> explains and optimizes
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Organizations that focus only on measurement remain reactive. Those
            that operationalize STAR move toward continuous license
            intelligence, lower audit exposure, and controlled SAP spend.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              The most sustainable SAP license optimization strategy does not
              begin with buying more tools—it begins with fully using what SAP
              already provides.
            </strong>
          </p>
