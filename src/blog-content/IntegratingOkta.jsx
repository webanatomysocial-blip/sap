          <p>
            The complexities of modern enterprise identity and access management
            (IAM) demand scalable, secure integrations between identity
            providers and authentication platforms. In this context, my latest
            video on integrating Okta with SAP Identity Authentication Service
            (IAS) and Identity Provisioning Service (IPS) provides practical,
            actionable guidance for IT architects and security engineers who are
            tackling hybrid identity scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below, I share a concise overview of the key concepts and why you
            should watch this video if you’re implementing enterprise IAM with
            Okta and SAP cloud identity services.

          <h2>Core Concepts Covered</h2>

          <h3>1. Why Integrate Okta with SAP IAS/IPS?</h3>
          <p>
            Enterprises increasingly run heterogeneous IAM architectures where
            corporate identity platforms like Okta serve authentication and
            provisioning across multiple services. SAP Cloud Identity Services —
            particularly Identity Authentication Service (IAS) for SSO and
            Identity Provisioning Service (IPS) for user lifecycle automation —
            are frequently used in SAP landscapes. Integrating Okta with these
            services helps unify authentication, streamline user provisioning,
            and enhance security governance across SAP and non-SAP applications.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Single Sign-On (SSO) with Okta and SAP IAS</h3>
          <p>
            The integration typically involves federating Okta as an external
            identity provider (IdP) to SAP IAS, using SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect
            (OIDC). Once trust is established between Okta and IAS, SAP
            applications can delegate authentication to Okta, enabling seamless
            SSO for users. SAP IAS can act either as the primary identity
            provider or as a proxy that redirects authentication to Okta based
            on conditional rules.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Identity Provisioning with SAP IPS</h3>
          <p>
            SAP IPS plays a pivotal role in automating user account creation and
            updates in cloud systems based on authoritative identity sources
            (such as Okta, HR systems, or directories). By integrating Okta with
            IPS, organizations ensure that user attributes and group assignments
            flow reliably into SAP IAS and other connected targets —
            streamlining onboarding, offboarding, and attribute synchronization.

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Combining Okta with SAP’s cloud identity services offers a powerful
            way to centralize authentication and automate identity lifecycle
            processes across your enterprise. Whether you’re just beginning your
            integration journey or refining an existing setup, the insights in
            this video will help you design a secure and scalable IAM
            architecture.
